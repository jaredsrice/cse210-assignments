        // a lot of effort into making sure that the breathing activity worked with as many numbers 
        // as possible, and wasn't obnoxiously long for a single cycle. 
        // For example, 6 seconds is one cycle of 2 seconds each, 
        // whereas 31 seconds is 2 cycles of 5 seconds each, with the last exhaling cycle
        // being 6 seconds. Bunch of math and error prevention in here.
